    According to the visualizations in the Profits/Losses Story, the two biggest profit centers are Copiers and Phones and the two biggest loss-makers are Tables and Bookcases across the whole USA. Regional differences in profit centers are as follows:
      Central Profits: Copiers and Phones
      Central Losses: Binders and Tables
      East Profits: Chairs and Copiers
      East Losses: Tables and Bookcases
      South Profits: Phones and Accessories
      South Losses: Tables and Machines
      West Profits: Copiers and Binders
      West Losses: Tables and Bookcases
    The superstore should stop selling Furniture products, as they account for the most loss across all regions (see Overall Profits/Losses SC).  
    The superstore should focus on Copiers, Phones, and Accessories as they are accounting for the majority of profit across most regions. They should stop selling Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies as they account for the majority of losses across most regions.


    The 3 most profitable states, according to the States v. MMYY for Ads worksheet, were California in December at $21,207; New York in September at $44,397; and Washington in March at $23,460. If the maximum amount spend on advertising is 1/5 of profits for the month then the ad expenses for those three states are as follows:
        California: $4,241.40
        New York: $8.879.40
        Washington: $4,692.00


    Make the Returned field into a calculated field where the null values are 0 and the Yes values are 1.
    The product subcategories with the highest numbers of returns are Binders, Paper, and Phones. However, the product subcategories with the highest return rates are Machines, Fasteners, and Chairs with return rates ranging from about 29%-35%, according to the worksheets Product Return Count and Product Return Rate.
     A few customers have a return rate of 100% and the average return rates of the customers is about 26%.
     
    If the superstore wants to remove some subcategories from the line-up then removeing Tables, Bookcases, and Office Supplies would be a good idea as they are the biggest loss-makers. If the superstore wanted to get rid of a whole category then removing the Furniture from the store would be ideal from the numbers presented as it accounts for the most loss and the least profit. The superstore can focus on the Technology category and bolster the biggest profit centers in the store.
